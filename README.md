# Wallarock API

REST API based on microservices built in Java using Spring Boot. Wallarock is a web application developed as a college project for learning purposes which implements the functionality of a second hand buying/selling platform in the style of [Wallapop](https://es.wallapop.com/).

## Architecture

![](Architecture_Diagram.png)

The API follows the microservices architectural style in which there are three different types of microservices:

1. The Client microservice is in charge of user management. Stores the user data in a SQL table.
2. The Catalog microservice is in charge of Products to buy/sell management. Stores the products data in a SQL table.
3. The Chat microservice is in charge of management of chats among users of the platform. Stores the chat data in a MongoDB collection
4. The [WallarockRestClient](https://github.com/manglaneso/Wallarock-client) is an example client for this API.
